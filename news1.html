          Around 1,500 villages in Gujarat, India, remain without electricity after cyclone Biparjoy, as coastal regions
          recover from the storm's impact, according to officials. Initially, more than 4,600 villages in Saurashtra and
          Kutch experienced power outages when the cyclone made landfall on Thursday.
        </p>

        <h2>Details</h2>

        <p>
          As a precautionary measure during the storm, power supply was cut off in many villages to prevent dangerous
          incidents, explained Gujarat Energy Secretary Mamta Verma in an interview with Reuters.
        </p>

        <p>
          Northern districts of the state continue to face heavy rains, leading to ongoing flooding. The adverse weather
          conditions persist despite efforts to restore electricity and tackle the aftermath of the cyclone.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, some ports along the coastline, including Pipavav Port and Kandla Port, have resumed operations. The
          Adani-owned Mundra Port is scheduled to restart operations from Saturday evening.
        </p>

        <p>
          The cyclone caused significant damage, particularly to power infrastructure, with thousands of electricity
          poles uprooted and overhead power lines damaged. Restoration work is underway on priority, focusing on
          electricity supply, drinking water, and repairing roads and other physical infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p>
          According to Gujarat's revenue secretary, Kamal Dayani, teams are actively working on the ground to restore
          essential services and infrastructure. The state government reported that over 700 homes in the eight coastal
          districts of Gujarat suffered full or partial damage.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fortunately, the cyclone resulted in only two deaths, which were those of two shepherds attempting to save
          their cattle from heavy rains and floods prior to the cyclone's landfall. Early warnings, accurate
          identification of vulnerable areas, and timely evacuations played a crucial role in preventing major
          casualties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both India and neighboring Pakistan successfully evacuated over 180,000 people from vulnerable areas as the
          cyclone approached, showcasing effective disaster preparedness and response measures.
        </p>
